The DojoBoy console is a DIY handheld game console project based on MicroPython

The main objectives of the project are:
- Cheap and easy to make with common components (no exotic components or custom PCB)
- Simple assembly with reduced tooling (soldering iron, screwdriver, Dremel tool)
- Easy printing of the case (3 parts only without supports)
- Game coding easy with only MicroPython libraries (no custom C codes, orginal MicroPython image based)
  - v 1.0 : All In One library
  - v 2.0 (WIP): Module with libraries (multiple objects) : object oriented coding, vector methods, extended features...
